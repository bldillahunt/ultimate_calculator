I found it impossible to find any type of calculator, real or virtual, that could convert a fixed point decimal value to its equivalent two's complement binary value. I encountered this a lot when working with large fixed point numbers that were needed for image processing algorithms that were implemented in a FPGA.  It's still a work in progess, I need to clean up the GUI and I plan to add a lot more conversion options, like IEEE754 single/double precision and large decimal to binary/hex values.
